# Test Cases

This document describes the current manual and scripted test scenarios for the Threat Detection & Response Server.

The current testing approach validates the server pipeline:

```text
Client
  → TCP Server
  → Message Parser
  → Threat Engine
  → Client State Tracker
  → Response Engine
  → Logger
  ```

The tests are currently focused on verifying server behavior, message handling, threat classification, per-client state tracking, response decisions, and file-based logging.
---

# Prerequisites

Build the server from the project root:
```bash
make clean
make
```

Start the server:
```bash
./threat_server
```

The server should start and listen on port 8080:

```text
[INFO] Threat Detection Server started.
[INFO] Listening on port 8080...
```

# Test Script: Manual Client

File:
```text
tests/manual_client.py
```
Purpose:

The manual client sends a predefined sequence of messages to the server through a single TCP connection.

Run:
```bash
python3 tests/manual_client.py
```
```text
Messages Sent
HEARTBEAT
STATUS OK
ERROR TEMP_HIGH
ERROR TEMP_HIGH
ERROR TEMP_HIGH
COMMAND INVALID
BADMESSAGE
STATUS
ERROR
```

# Expected Behavior
```text
Message 	    Expected Parse Result	Threat Level	Expected Response

HEARTBEAT	    valid heartbeat	        NORMAL	        ALLOW

STATUS OK	    valid status	        NORMAL	        ALLOW
ERROR TEMP_HIGH	valid error	            SUSPICIOUS	    MONITOR

third repeated  valid error	            SUSPICIOUS	    BLOCK_CANDIDATE
ERROR TEMP_HIGH                                         after escalation

COMMAND INVALID	valid command	        CRITICAL	    BLOCK_CANDIDATE

BADMESSAGE	    unknown message     	CRITICAL	    BLOCK_CANDIDATE

STATUS	        missing payload	        CRITICAL	    BLOCK_CANDIDATE

ERROR	        missing payload	        CRITICAL	    BLOCK_CANDIDATE
```

# What This Test Validates
- TCP client connection handling
- plain-text message receiving
- message parsing
- malformed input detection
- rule-based threat classification
- suspicious activity escalation
- response decision generation
- structured file logging

# Test Script: Multi-Client Simulation


File:
```text
tests/multi_client_test.py
```
Purpose:

The multi-client test simulates several clients connecting to the server at the same time. Each simulated client runs in its own Python thread and sends a different message sequence.

Run:
```bash
python3 tests/multi_client_test.py
```

# Example Client Scenarios
```text
client_normal:
  HEARTBEAT
  STATUS OK
  HEARTBEAT

client_suspicious:
  HEARTBEAT
  ERROR TEMP_HIGH
  ERROR TEMP_HIGH

client_critical:
  COMMAND INVALID
  BADMESSAGE
  STATUS
```

#Expected Behavior

The server should:

- accept multiple connections
- sign each connection a different source port
- process messages from multiple clients without crashing
- write all events to the log file
- continue applying parser, threat, state, response, and logging logic to each event

Example log identifiers:
```text
client_ip=127.0.0.1
client_port=46124

client_ip=127.0.0.1
client_port=46132

client_ip=127.0.0.1
client_port=46148
```

# Important Note About Localhost Testing

When running multiple simulated clients locally, all clients may appear as:
```text
client_ip=127.0.0.1
```

with different source ports.

The current client state tracker uses the client IP address as the client identity. This means multiple localhost clients share the same tracked state.

This is expected for the current implementation.

The multi-client test currently validates:

- concurrent connection handling
- thread-per-client processing
- logging under concurrent activity
- pipeline stability with multiple active clients

It does not fully validate separate IP-based client state because all local simulated clients use the same localhost IP.

Future improvements may use:

- different physical devices on the home network
- IP + port as a temporary client identifier
- explicit client_id fields in messages
- authenticated client identity

# Log Verification

After running either test script, inspect the log file:
```text
tail -n 120 logs/threat_log.txt
```

Each event should include:
```text
[EVENT]
timestamp=
client_ip=
client_port=
raw_message=
message_type=
valid=
threat_level=
threat_reason=
client_state=
total_events=
normal_events=
suspicious_events=
critical_events=
state_reason=
response_action=
response_reason=
```

For messages with payloads, the log should also include:
```text
payload=
```
For malformed or unknown messages, the log should include:
```text
parse_error=
```

# Current Test Coverage

The current tests validate:

- server startup
- TCP socket listening
- client connection handling
- thread-per-client behavior
- raw message receiving
- message parsing
- valid and invalid input handling
- threat classification
- repeated suspicious activity escalation
- per-IP client state tracking
- response decision generation
- file-based structured logging

---
# Known Testing Limitations

The current tests do not yet validate:

- authenticated client identity
- separate state across multiple real IP addresses
- encrypted communication
- JSON message validation
- heartbeat timeout detection
- actual firewall blocking
- database persistence
- automated pass/fail assertions

These are planned for future development phases.

# Future Test Improvements

Planned improvements include:

- testing with multiple devices on the same home network
- adding explicit client_id support
- adding automated expected-output validation
- adding parser unit tests
- adding threat engine unit tests
- adding response engine unit tests
- adding JSON-based test cases
- adding stress tests with higher client counts
